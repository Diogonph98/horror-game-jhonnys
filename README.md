# Horror Jhonnys Game

Description regarding levels design of the game (tbn).

# Introduction

An advanced civilization has been mining and colonizing (?) spacial bodies (read planets, moons, asteroids). To do so, specialized squads (read groups) were created. Each squad has a maximum of 4 members (read players), and their own spacial base/ship. 

In the beginning of the game, the squad is at the lowest level: a very rudimentar spaceship, which only allows them to travel to low-profitable planets, and the corresponding players have no powerups to help them with their activities.

The goal of the game: the squad should travel to several space bodies and gather resources without dying. There are two possible outcomes of this:

- use the resources gathered to improve the spaceship, allowing the squad to travel farther (?) distances and visit more profitable environments;
- use the resources gathered and sell them at a specific place (imagine some sort of shitty space station) which allows the players to buy powerups (more stamina, more inventory spaces, run faster, etc).

# Further game mechanics

## Environments

Initially there are three types of game environments:

- Spaceship: center of operations for the squad, where they can store items retrieved, navigate to other colonies, etc.
- Space Station: a space station filled with merchants and other NPCs that could help the players improve their own characters (e.g. through the sell of powerups)
- Colonies: these can be planets, moons, asteroids or any other space objects. Places to where the squads can travel to, in order to gather resources and other relevant goods.

## Spaceship components

- Engine: allows the spaceship to travel farther distances. Mandatory upgrade to travel to higher level space bodies.
- Radiation Protection: protects the spaceship from hazardous radiation emitted by other bodies, allowing them to stay longer orbiting space bodies (e.g. at level 1, the players can stay 8 minutes exploring a planet, at level 2 they can stay 9 minutes, at level 5 they can stay 12 minutes, and so on. Specific values up to discussion).

## Space bodies

### Level 1 (no spaceship upgrades required):
- Moon
- Mars

### Level 2 (requires some sort of upgrades, e.g. engine upgraded):
- Venus
- Asteroid belt

### Level 3 (requires further spaceship upgrades):
- Mercury
- Jupiter
- Europa
- Ganymedes

### Level 4 (requires further spaceship upgrades + character powerups advised)
- Io
- Callisto
- Saturn

## Resources
These are goods that the players can gather when exploring the colonies. They can be used to:
- upgrade spaceship
- buy powerups (e.g. run faster, more stamina, etc)
- buy relevant items (e.g. weapons)
