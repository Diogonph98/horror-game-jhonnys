# Horror Jhonnys Game

Description regarding levels design of the game (tbn).

# Introduction

An advanced civilization has been mining and colonizing (?) spacial bodies (read planets, moons, asteroids). To do so, specialized squads (read groups) were created. Each squad has a maximum of 4 members (read players), and their own spacial base/ship. 

In the beginning of the game, the squad is at the lowest level: a very rudimentar spaceship, which only allows them to travel to low-profitable planets, and the corresponding players have no powerups to help them with their activities.

The goal of the game: the squad should travel to several space bodies and gather resources without dying. There are two possible outcomes of this:

- use the resources gathered to improve the spaceship, allowing the squad to travel farther (?) distances and visit more profitable environments;

- use the resources gathered and sell them at a specific place (imagine some sort of shitty space station) which allows the players to buy powerups (more stamina, more inventory spaces, run faster, etc).
